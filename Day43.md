## Day 43
By now, each day of work feels like just another day.  I found a YouTube video that encapsulates the first few months on the job: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkGHaPwj29Y

Here's the summary I just entered in my hours-tracking app for the morning:

Project [redacted]
Software Engineer
4:00
-generated noisy dataset of 200,000,000 instances
-generated Levenshtein distance visualizations for shareback
-spiked on pysparkâ€™s MLlib for XGBoost classification modeling of [redacted]

When I started, I would have been intimidated by most of the words I just wrote, and now it feels normal, though I still feel like a complete beginner.  I'm naive when it comes to the amount of time and effort required to develop anything, and more than once I've made comments to the effect of "This should be easy," and had the lead engineers (kindly) knock me down.  A production environment streaming real data is entirely different, complexity-wise, than an experimental model, and I still don't know the boundaries of those differences.

I felt pressure yesterday to get this large data generation task done (it's taken me longer than anyone would like), and then it worked after a lot of learning and troubleshooting.  Stress at work is qualitatively different at this job.  It's not about making sure you're as neutrally nice as possible so you don't get complaints from customers; it's about learning new vocabularies and tools quickly.  Your niceness barely matters; your output does.  I'm not the world's fastest learner, and if they're not satisfied with my work, they have until about August 1 to fire me before some benefits kick in.  It's rolling around in my mind every day.

At this point, I'd encourage anybody to consider a job as a developer, because the work is mentally stimulating, pays well, and has reasonable hours and stability. Also it's a field you can break into if you're self-taught.  I wonder if I'm becoming a tech bro.  It's easy, because when you're immersed in a field and it treats you well, you feel an affinity for it.  Also there's no question of its utility and application.  But I wonder if that's blinding me to some of the darker parts of what I'm doing.
