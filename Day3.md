## A Strategy

To deal with all the new tech vocabulary, I've developed a strategy.  I keep a notebook page each day with three sections titled Learn, Schedule, and Project.  Every time I hear someone mention a concept or a technology I don't know about, I make a bullet point in the Learn section.  At some point during the day, I Google it.  If it's a tool I might have to use soon, I'll put a squiggle to indicate that I should do a tutorial or watch a longer YouTube video about it.  Otherwise I check it off once I've learned what it is.  I know 18 more tech-related vocab words than I did when I started on Monday.  I had to repeat a couple because I forgot them overnight.  It's okay.  Now I have a slightly better idea what my coworkers are talking about (VPC? EC2?), and I can kind of chuckle along when people make jokes.

Btw it's only day three and I'm already growing used to having healthy, fancy lunch brought in by the company every day.  And having a fridge full of the most expensive sparkling water.
