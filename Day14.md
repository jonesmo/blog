## Overwhelm Eases

I'm three weeks in and have been so absorbed in learning that I haven't written.  It was about a week and a half of total overwhelm, followed by a week and a half of confidence that, even though I don't know a lot, I'll be able to learn in reasonable time.  Now I'm typing this during a Zoom "training" with a colleague, who's talking about technologies so unfamiliar that I'm not getting anything out of watching them wrestle with Kubernetes.

I've filled a chunk of a notebook with definitions and self-teaching, and I've managed to understand and build and deploy Docker containers on AWS using GitHub Actions and Terraform.  Today I'm starting on a week of shadowing a more complex project that uses Google Cloud Platform with Concourse, so a completely different set of tools that do something similar.
