### I Love This Job
This role doesn't just allow time for new learning and creative thinking; it encourages it.  The salary and benefits and office and perks around the role are there to facilitate healthy brain work. I feel happy and less stressed.  I'm getting exercise and feel energized from my day.  When I realize I have to go to work in the morning, I feel happy about it.  It's a new way of relating to work.

## Pile Of Tools
I mentioned before that tech is a pile of vocabulary.  It's also a pile of tools.  Each tool is an abstraction built on top of other abstractions.  Somewhere there are people who know how individual electrical switches (0/1 binary) are choreographed into the marvels of computing.  It turns out most engineers don't know that stuff.  I certainly don't.  Each engineer knows a lot of different tools that are high-level abstractions of that, a subset of the universe of possible tools, but no engineer is super experienced with everything.  It's therefore a pretty egalitarian interaction to be on an engineering team, because each person brings a unique experience and history, and it's a matter of negotiating which person can do which tasks.  Everyone has something to contribute.  Even I, the newbie, was able to catch a few bugs today.

The layers of abstraction are intense.  There are so many layers, and so many kinds of abstraction, and so many ways of thinking about them.  I like it best when I find tutorials that provide visual representations of layers of abstraction, like a map of "where" each tool sits.  It seems like there may be tools that can't be neatly described with diagrams, though, and I'm still learning how to understand those.

### Teamwork
As much as I tend to favor independent work and feel more focused when I'm alone, the reality is two sets of eyes are valuable.  There are a lot of details to be considered in programming, and two brains considering different details leads to faster, better outcomes.  Thankfully I like everyone I work with.

### Back to Testing
As I write this, I'm procrastinating learning to use pytest, because testing code is a daunting subject.  I don't even really know what it is.  Better go study.
